##### EP 749 Assignment 4 #####
##  HW Description  ##
# 1.	Create a shell for the Table 1 that you plan to use for your data analysis project.  
# a.	At a minimum, please include information about the following: 
#   sex, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, employment, 
#   annual income, health coverage, shingles vaccination, tetanus vaccination. 
#   You may include additional variables if you like, but this is not required.
# b.	It is your choice as to whether or not you want to include prevalence ratios in your Table 1. 
#   You will not be penalized if you decide not to do this. 
#   If you do report prevalence ratio measures, 
#   please be intentional in how you select and report reference categories.   
# c.	You are welcome to update your Table 1 even after you turn it in as part of this homework assignment. 
#   The purpose of including Table 1 in this assignment is to give everyone one last opportunity to 
#   receive feedback if you need it, and to help you get Â¼ of the deliverables for your data analysis 
#   project out of the way. We will not be discussing this finalized version of Table 1 in class next week.
# 
# 2.	Create table shells for Tables 2 and 3 of the data analysis project. 
# a.	These shells can be rough drafts you are not required to have settled 
#   on the final content or format of your tables for this assignment. 
#   I want you to turn something in, however, so I can see who needs 
#   some help to think through their analysis. 
# b.	We will spend time in class discussing your table shells from the perspective 
#   of how to plan an analysis (we will not be discussing formatting).

# #### You will need to decide which associations you want to present
